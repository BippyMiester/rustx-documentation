## Things to Note

This plugin and website are in Beta Testing Phase. The reason for this is because I'm testing the plugins performance and I can only test so much being one guy. There's a ton of data being collected with the plugin, and I want to ensure that there isn't a huge degradation of your performance. So any feedback will help me get this plugin out of beta faster.

The website is also "under construction". I'm adding more and more data statistics modules each day, but I want to get this plugin out there and get your feedback. (Yes, I plan to introduce a dark mode to the website. Just not high on my priority list. :P)

Join my Discord server! I constantly update both the plugin and the website, and it can automatically notify you of new updates. I'll be releasing more versions there, and only releasing stable versions here on Codefling.com.
